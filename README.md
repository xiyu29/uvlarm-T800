# UV Larm
In this project, we will realise a robot which can avoid all the obstacles while moving in a small area.

In this context, the robot will be able to move and turn when there is an obstacle in front of it, meanwhile, the obstcle will not give a strong influence on its movement.

# Launch file for challenge 1

    ros2 launch grp_T800 sim_launch.yaml
For the movement of the robot :
